# .dotfiles

These are the files that make me better at using the computer.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url> ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Preview setup (dry run)
./dot setup --dry-run

# Run full setup
./dot setup

# Verify everything works
./dot doctor
```

## 🎮 The `dot` CLI

All dotfiles operations are managed through the `dot` command:

```bash
dot setup       # Initial setup for new machine
dot link        # Link configs with GNU Stow
dot unlink      # Remove symlinks
dot doctor      # Run health diagnostics
dot update      # Update all packages and tools
dot package     # Manage Brewfile packages
```

Most commands support `--dry-run` to preview changes:
```bash
dot setup --dry-run
dot link --dry-run
dot update --dry-run
```

## 📦 Package Management

All Homebrew packages are declared in `packages/Brewfile`:

```bash
# Add a package
dot package add bat

# Remove a package
dot package remove nushell

# List all packages
dot package list

# Sync installed packages with Brewfile
dot package sync
```

For work-specific packages, use `packages/Brewfile.work`.

## 🔗 Configuration Linking

Uses **GNU Stow** to symlink configs from `home/` to `~`:

```
home/.zshrc           → ~/.zshrc
home/.tmux.conf       → ~/.tmux.conf
home/.aerospace.toml  → ~/.aerospace.toml
home/.config/nvim     → ~/.config/nvim
home/.config/wezterm  → ~/.config/wezterm
```

## 📋 What's Included

### Package Management

## 📝 Applications

### neovim
Hey... \*lowers sunglasses\* I use neovim, you know. It's a pretty basic LazyVim setup with a couple tweaks. The theme is called Bamboo, and it matches my default WezTerm config.

### tmux
I've actually been using tmux for a while so this one is pretty comprehensive. Having experimented with Zellij (which is also very cool!) I still find that I prefer tmux.

### .zshrc
I found that Oh My Zsh became pretty slow, which I'm sure is a skill issue. The way I solved it was to use zinit and handle a lot more configuration myself, so there's quite a bit going on here. I added some profiling behavior so I can keep a better eye on this.

### WezTerm
Fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator with great config flexibility. My setup includes custom key bindings, tab bar styling, and integration with the Bamboo color scheme.

### AeroSpace
Tiling window manager for macOS. Configured for keyboard-driven window management with vim-style navigation.

## 🚀 Quick Tips
